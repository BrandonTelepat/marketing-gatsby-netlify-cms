description: As a startup founder, there are many different methods to save your
  company money. Money saved in the early start-up stage can go towards other
  mission-critical activities to accelerate the growth of your company. Yet many
  startups are either unaware of these savings or don’t have the time or
  personnel to dedicate to cost savings.

**As founders, we understand time and resources are just as valuable in the startup phase. Both Rebate and Usage AI provide exceptional customer support to ensure your process is quick and risk-free while maximizing your total savings.**

Last month, a mid-sized software company saved a total of ***$102,000*** using both Usage and Rebate. [Find out how](https://calendly.com/usage-ai/30min?month=2022-02/?).

###  

### **So why is it so hard to find the money you’re owed as a startup founder?**

1. Most companies are unaware or assume they don’t qualify; *and/or*
2. Many small businesses/startups don’t have the luxury of a finance team to search for credits and other savings/discounts

 

**Problem: The IRS offers tax incentives and credits that can be difficult to claim**

***Solution: Working with Rebate***

The IRS Research & Development (also known as R&D) tax credit is available to any business that “attempts to develop new, improved, or technologically advanced products or trade processes”, and was originally developed to encourage and promote innovation for small businesses. 

Many businesses miss out on their claim of the R&D credit because of misconceptions or confusion on qualifying activities, expenditures, and how the credit can be used. The key is understanding and identifying your business’ efforts and related costs towards innovation and improvement. 

If you’re spending resources on qualified R&D activities, you can get money back from the U.S. government – money to further propel your business.

At Rebate, we believe education is crucial in creating awareness of this tax program and its benefits. As founders, we – regretfully – missed out on these credits in our earlier entrepreneurial days and don’t want the same thing to happen to you. 

If you’re a small or medium-sized business in any industry, [try our free calculator tool](https://app.rebate.us/calculator) to see if you qualify.  We’ll ask you a few questions and our R&D tax credit software will calculate your savings estimate. From here, we combine automation with the R&D expertise of real accountants. And unlike anyone else, we complete a full R&D study for your business with full audit protection — no risks, no worries. *It’s really that easy.* 

 

**Problem: AWS offers discounts that can be difficult to claim**

***Solution: Working with Usage AI***

AWS offers 2 main billing modes for EC2 instances: on-demand and reserved. On-demand is the default mode of billing and offers the greatest flexibility at the highest possible cost. It’s a fair tradeoff given you only pay when the instance is on, and not when the instance is off. On the other hand, reserved mode gives you up to 57% savings if you’re willing to commit to using an instance for 3 years. 

Most AWS customers go with on-demand since they don’t need to worry about forecasting what they’ll be using in the future. They pay a premium for it, but the flexibility is a nice-to-have.

Customers who can forecast their needs up to 3 years out enjoy a 57% cost reduction for zero additional engineering work and no downtime. However, most organizations don’t have the ability to forecast their instance usage 3 years into the future. 

Usage combines the best of both: the same on/off flexible commitment as on-demand with the deep 57% savings of RIs (Reserved Instances). Usage **buys** RIs daily when new instances need to be covered to increase savings, and **sells** RIs when they’re no longer needed.

Usage provides:

* 57% savings on EC2
* Instant savings implementation with zero R&D work
* No commitment to Usage or AWS

###  

### **What if you could get the money you’re owed from both instantly?** 

By working with Usage and Rebate, you save time and resources that can be directed to your mission-critical activities to keep growing. 

It’s time to realize your savings of ***up to $100K***.
