description: As a startup founder, there are many different methods to save your
  company money. Money saved in the early start-up stage can go towards other
  mission-critical activities to accelerate the growth of your company. Yet many
  startups are either unaware of these savings or don’t have the time or
  personnel to dedicate to cost savings.

That’s where [Rebate](https://rebate.us/) and [Usage AI](http://usage.ai/) come in.  We are created by founders for founders with one unified mission: *to pass on significant cost-saving benefits to your startup*

**Combining our two seamless automated platforms, you can:**

1. Qualify for and claim tens of thousands of dollars in tax credits and other government incentives; and
2. Save up to 57% on your cloud expenditures.

Last month, a mid-sized software company saved a total of **_$102,000_** using both Usage and Rebate. [Find out how](https://calendly.com/usage-ai/30min?month=2022-02/?).

### **So why is it so hard to find the money you’re owed as a startup founder?**

1. Most companies are unaware or assume they don’t qualify; *and/or*
2. Many small businesses/startups don’t have the luxury of a finance team to search for credits and other savings/discounts
